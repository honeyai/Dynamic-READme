##  Project Links
https://github.com/honeyai/Dynamic-READme<br>

## Third Party Used:<br>
inquirer.js[inquirer.js]https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer
  
## Project Objective
READmes are full of information. It's hard to always remember what you need to include and even then you might forget a section. This CLI aims at helping in that process by providing all the prompts and filling in a READme with your answers.



## Technologies 
```
inquirer.js,javascript,promisfy
```

## Installation
Ensure you have node.js on your system. After closing this repo, run ```npm i``` in your console. After node finishes installing run ```node index.js``` while being in the root folder of the repo.


## Usage 
Once you run ```node index.js``` answer all the prompts. Once that's done, you should shortly see a new READme file or if you already have one it should write the new info provided into the existing READme.
